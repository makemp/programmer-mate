                    Plenty of manual work, including working with invoices, client data, and other types of tasks, can be automated. Employees can focus on truly important, creative tasks that need deeper insight, while simple, repeatable tasks can be automated using various scripts written in modern scripting languages like Python, Ruby, PowerShell, Bash, and more.

                        MS Excel is a very versatile tool that allows you to work with data in various ways. Many companies miss the opportunity to leverage this tool to the next level. We help companies enhance their use of the tool by utilizing VBA (Visual Basic for Applications), a scripting language built into MS Excel. Thanks to VBA, standard Excel sheets can be transformed into powerful tools that can handle files, networking, and in-depth data analysis.

                    <p class="text">
                        Thanks to chatbots, your clients can "talk" to your data. It is a very convenient way to find information on products on your page. Imagine this scenario: a company sells DIY articles. A client writes to a chatbot about their plan to repaint their daughter's room. The chatbot not only describes which products might be used but also returns links to products on the company's page! Thanks to cloud computing and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), this powerful yet low-cost solution is just a stone's throw away.
